    <p class="release-notes center">Release v.0.0.1: This is the very first release of this application</p>
    <h4 class="center">This birthday tracker application is a basic site developed by Andrew Fowose intended to help all users keep track of the birthdays in our immediate and extended families. There is a database backing the application that will store all user birthdays, so you won't ever have to commit these birthdays to memory again! Use freely and please send to any other family members. The goal is to be able to advance this application to keep us all connected and hopefully discover things about each other that we never previously knew...starting with each others' birthdays!  </h4>
